\section{Conclusion}
Estimation of software development projects is difficult. It requires a lot of prerequisites and experience to
be able to estimate a software project correctly. We have throughout this report tried to analyse some different
estimation techniques to try to find out if some techniques are more suitable than others for different kinds of
projects.
* What worked for us?
* Best results for 4 months project
* What could be better?
* How does the different techniques affect the teams' ability to estimate?

\subsection{Faults and errors}
Has working under these conditions, with international collaboration and part-time work on the project, non-optimal SCRUM (should we have used it at all?), affected the validity of our results and conclusion?
