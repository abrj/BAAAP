\section{Motivation}
In the start of every project, no matter what kind of project and in what sector, the first things that stakeholders, executive people and other similar persons are interested in, is the price of the project and the time frame that he project is about to enter. Questions like: "When can we expect the first prototype" and "When is the product ready to be shipped of to customers", are  ones that often is needed to be answered in the start of a project typical by a manager. For the manager point of view, this can often be a challenge to answer, mainly due to the fact the 'requirements' for the project at this point are often vaguely defined and a more a wish-list that actually requirements, that can be translated into program features.
