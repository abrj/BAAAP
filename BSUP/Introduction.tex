\section{Motivation}
In the start of every software project, the first things that stakeholders, executive people and other similar persons are interested in, is the price of the project and the time frame that he project is about to enter. Questions like: "When can we expect the first prototype" and "When is the product ready to be shipped of to customers", are  ones that often is needed to be answered in the start of a project typical by a manager. For the manager point of view, this can often be a challenge to answer, mainly due to the fact the 'requirements' for the project, at this point, are often vaguely defined and more a wish-list than actually requirements, that can be translated into program features. This combined with the fact, that developing a pierce of software from scratch often require a certain amount of innovation. Even though the project  will use known and common technologies and developing methods, these can be combined in a new way and this can both be time consuming and some time troublesome.\\
Because of this, many estimates for software project have often gone bad over time and the predicted delivery dates often been exceeded with several percentages (KILDE OOA/D bogen).
