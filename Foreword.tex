\section{Foreword}
There has been a great deal of development within the world of tutorials ever since the original idea of a tutor was first established at Oxford University in the 15th century. Back then, the scholars became responsible for the proper education of their fellow colleagues. Today, the expansive growth within the technological area, with the Internet as one of its central parts, has ensured a rapid development of online tutorials, making it possible for the average person to attain knowledge and knowhow of virtually every imaginable subject, ranging from gardening to the creation of your own rocket.
All that is needed is an internet connection along with a sense of curiosity and a willingness to learn.\\

%Skal vi ikke udlade det her?
%Our site offers tutorials which is specifically centered around the area of technology and our longterm goal is to make it as close to self-sustainable as possible, by focusing on user generated content. One incentive for this is that uploaders will get paid for other users watching their videos, thus making sure that the tutorials are of as high quality as possible in order to get higher ratings and more users.%
