\section{Vision}
In the following a system will be proposed, where it is possible for a user to rent, purchase and upload different kind of media files. These media files will be in the form of tutorials and the author of the file(s), will be paid through the system when the users purchases or rents the media file. The program will include a registry of available media files for the user, which have been tagged by the author. This gives the users the option to search for different files in categories and also rate the media files.\\

A user can either rent or purchase a tutorial. If the user rents a tutorial it will only be available for a given time period and include some form of advertisement. If the user chooses to purchase a tutorial it will be available to the user for good. \\ 
In other words our vision is to make a service which will include some educational technology related tutorials and  where the author of a good and thorough tutorial will be awarded financial for the work.
