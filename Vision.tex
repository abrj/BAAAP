\section{Vision}
In the following a program will be proposed, where it is possible for a user to rent, download and upload different kind of media files. These media files will be in the form of tutorials and the author of the file(s), will be paid through the service when the users download or rents the media file. The program will include a registry of available media files, which have been tagged by the author. This gives the users the option to search for different files in categories and possibly rate the media files.
A user can either rent or buy a tutorial. If the user rents a tutorial it will only be available for a given time period. If the user buys a tutorial it will be available to the user for good. If a user decides to buy a tutorial after a rent period, the amount paid for the rent will be subtracted from the buying price. 
In other words our vision is to make a service where the author of a good and thorough tutorial will be awarded for the work.
