\section{Client}

It was a requirement for this project that we too made a client that uses the WCF services. 
For this task we chose to use Microsoft's ASP.NET Framework together with their MVC4 framework
that is suitable for web applications. We chose to use MVC4 and thereby the Model, View, Controller
design pattern, due to the fact that none from our group had really done any web development in
ASP.NET before, but one did have some basic experience with the MVC design pattern from some 
Ruby on Rails projects. The reason that we did not choose to use another framework than ASP.NET
was simply that we thought it was mandatory to use a Microsoft technology. 
We did, however, not use the MVC4 Framework exactly how it is supposed to be used. Where our
approach differentiated from the intended way to use it, was that we did not use the auto generated
models in the Framework. This was due to the fact that we are not running the server and client
the same place like one would usually do when using the MVC4 Framework for web development. 
Instead we are running the models and database on our WCF server.
Together with MVC4 we basically only used HTML5 generated by the Razor syntax. For the 
basic layout we used CSS generated by Twitters Bootstrap framework. We have only used very little
Javascript that has been auto generated by Bootstrap.
